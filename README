What is ZVM?
============

The goal of the ZVM project is to write a pure-python implementation
of a Z-machine, a virtual computer architecture that executes
interactive fiction stories written in a special language, called
Z-code.

The current goals of the project include:

    * No user interface: ZVM implements only the actual Z-machine. It
      is meant to be used as the backend in other programs that
      provide a user interface.

    * Compatibility: ZVM will implement a Z-Machine architecture
      according to the official specification.

    * Coverage: Over the years, the Z-machine architecture was revised
      and refined: 8 versions are known to exist. ZVM currently aims
      to support Z-machine versions 1 through 5.

    * Programming language: ZVM is written exclusively in the Python
      programming language, as an importable code module.
